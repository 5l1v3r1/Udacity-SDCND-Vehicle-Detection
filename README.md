## Descriptions

For keras 1

**ssd_download_essentials.ipynb:** Run this notebook first to download SSD implemnetation, moviepy package and target video from github.

**SSD_car_detection.ipynb:** Car detection using SSD is done in the first 6 cells.

For keras 2

**ssd_download_essentials_keras2.ipynb:** Run this notebook first to download SSD implemnetation, moviepy package and target video from github.

**SSD_car_detection_keras2.ipynb:** Car detection using SSD is done in the first 6 cells. This script will be in ./ssd_keras-master after running ssd_download_essentials_keras2.ipynb
